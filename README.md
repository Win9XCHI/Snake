# C ++ console snake.

The player controls a snake that crawls along a plane bounded by walls and collects
food avoiding collision with its own tail and the edges of the playing field. Everytime,
when the snake eats a piece of food, it becomes longer, which gradually complicates the game.
The player controls the direction of movement of the snake's head (4 directions: up, down, left,
right), and the snake's tail follows. The player cannot stop the movement of the snake. Glasses
the player should be displayed next to the field. If the player loses he can start over.

## Requirements:
1. Create a project in MS Visual Studio C ++, version 17-19;
2. Show knowledge and ability to use the principles of OOP, work with multithreading;
3. There should be comments in the code;
4. There should be a start menu.

### Additional tasks:
1. The longer the snake, the faster it moves.
2. Create a demo mode in which the player simply watches the snake “play itself”.
